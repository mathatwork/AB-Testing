After some research you find that many of your emails are ending up in spam or junk folders.  You believe this is because the subject line in most of your emails contain the word FREE which is one of the most common spam words.  You think that a fewer percentage of emails will go to the spam folder if you replace the word FREE with COMPLIMENTARY in the subject line."
